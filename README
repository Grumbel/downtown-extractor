Downtown Data Extractor
=======================

The Downtown Data Extractor allows the extraction of the data files
(music, sound, textures, etc) from the following games:

 * Goin' Downtown
 * Everlight 

The data structure of these games is pretty straight forward:

 * resources.meta is an sqlite3 db that contains all file entries,
   along with offset, size and resource file index

 * resources.d{idx} are the files containing the data

 * music and sound are Ogg files

 * textures are DDS

 * there is a bunch of Python code and some Swig bindings

 * voice files are in a separate set of resource files having the
   prefix "german"


Usage
=====

 $ downtown_extractor.py -d "/win/Program Files/The Games Company/Downtown/" --list
